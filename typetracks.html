    <p>I tend to make instrumentals that are geared towards artists that I currently listen to now or have listened to in the past (those are some of the coolest ones). Here are some artist's that people have said "I could see ... going on that":</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lana Del Ray</li>
        <li>Metro Boomin</li>
        <li>Yung Gravy</li>
        <li>Gunna</li>
        <li>Flume</li>
        <li>Juice Wrld</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Of course, there is some orginality to my instrumentals as well. It doesn't just have to be like other artists, I can help create a unique sound for you!</p>
