<p>I have had many years of experience of music throughout my life so far. I have always been steady making instrumentals of different genres. My favorite genre to produce is Hip Hop, but I am always open to other genres of music. At first, I would have never thought to become as professional as I am today about it, but suddenly (like graduating high school) I have. Back when I was like a mega sponge for information about how to become better I admit today that those instrumentals were not anywhere near what I make currently. To this day, my friends still tease me about the first beat that I ever made. I actually ended up trying to copy a melody my friend made, but ended up with something worse. Through the years, I picked up on recording vocals and quickly began experimenting with my own because no one in my area wanted to make music like I did. A high school friend named, Raw Reese, on Spotify was one to always come to my studio before he went out on deployment. He was one of the main reasons I was so persistant on music because he always wanted more.</p>
